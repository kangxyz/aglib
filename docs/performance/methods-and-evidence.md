## Methods and evidence

| Method | When it can help | Evidence and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Align object, codomain and instance representations explicitly | Different inferred expressions are definitionally equal but expensive to compare | The Tensor experiment above is direct local evidence. Extra annotations that elaborate to identical core terms need not help. Inspect the expressions first. |
| Generate explicit simplifier equality certificates | A `simp` proof leaves expensive reductions implicit | [Lean issue 14331](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/14331) reports a severe case improved by `simp -implicitDefEqProofs`. The pinned default remains `true`. Test only implicated calls and measure the complete declaration; this is not a direct replacement for a literal `rfl`. |
| Name repeated proof arguments before elaborating the statement and body | Large embedded proofs or differently represented proof types are repeatedly compared | The [primary-author discussion](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/270676-lean4/topic/dsimp.20simplifies.20proofs.2C.20which.20is.20slow.html) explains both improvements and regressions. Its 0.06-to-10-second kernel regression concerned an experimental branch, not a demonstrated current compiler bug. |
| Use `as_aux_lemma` for identified duplicated proof terms | Proof bodies are duplicated in generated terms or simplifier results | The [pinned tactic](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/v4.34.1/src/Init/Tactics.lean#L13-L18) and [Mathlib examples](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/d13f23b723b8a846827a245b89c10fc7d3f11612/Mathlib/Logic/Equiv/Basic.lean#L280-L291) provide the existing mechanism. Smaller terms can still require more conversion; abstraction is not an automatic kernel optimization. |
| Separate construction data from correctness proofs | Repeated large structures or generated correctness terms are the measured problem | Mathlib explicitly splits [projective resolutions](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/d13f23b723b8a846827a245b89c10fc7d3f11612/Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Abelian/Projective/Resolution.lean#L289-L310) for performance. Preserve the actual component formulas and consumers that unfold them. |
| Preserve useful regular definition boundaries | Kernel reduction order expands a large argument before a small wrapper | [Kernel reduction hints](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/v4.34.1/src/Lean/Declaration.lean#L17-L47) explain why `def` and `abbrev` can behave differently. Elaborator attributes such as `irreducible` are a different mechanism. True `opaque` data changes the reduction interface and requires deliberate API design. |
| Align parent instances and supply universe information | Diagnostics show instance synthesis or universe unification dominating | These primarily address elaboration. They are lower priority for the current kernel-heavy profiles; the presence of category instances alone does not diagnose an instance diamond. |

An especially relevant open lead is [Lean issue 14803](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/14803)
and its proposed [PR 14927](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/14927).
They describe fast elaboration followed by expensive kernel comparison of an
application with its eta expansion. The proposed change tries eta before delta
reduction. The PR was open and unmerged when inspected, and the pinned source
still uses the reported order. This is a diagnostic lead: Aglib's actual
conversion pair must match before attributing its cost to that mechanism.

Similarly, [PR 14770](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/14770) provides a
concrete wrapper-unfolding example. A merged PR is not sufficient evidence that
its exact implementation is present in a release: inspect the pinned source.
Do not change toolchains based only on an issue title or a historical speedup.
